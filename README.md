# GPT-2 Language Model for Text Generation

This project is an implementation of the GPT-2 language model for text generation using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset and can generate coherent text based on a given prompt. It is capable of generating text for various applications such as content generation, chatbots, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prabhiraj-P/gpt2-language-model.git
   ```

# Install the required Python packages:

bash
```
pip install torch matplotlib
```
Download the pre-trained GPT-2 model (if available) and save it in the project directory.

Explore the code and usage examples.

# Usage
You can use the GPT-2 model for text generation by providing a prompt. Here's how you can generate text using the provided model:

python
```
prompt = 'Once upon a time'
context = torch.tensor(encode(prompt), dtype=torch.long)
generated_text = decode(model.generate(context.unsqueeze(0), max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist())
print(generated_text)
```
Replace the prompt variable with your desired text, and the model will generate text based on that input.

# Training
If you want to train the GPT-2 model on your own dataset, you can follow these steps:

Prepare your training data and preprocess it.

Update the model architecture and parameters in the code to match your requirements.

Train the model using your dataset.

Save the trained model for later use.

# Example
In the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script, you'll find an example of using the GPT-2 model to generate text based on a given prompt.
